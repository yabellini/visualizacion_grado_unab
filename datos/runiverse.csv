All operations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate either
on a single frame or a series of frames for working with layers, collages,
or animation. In RStudio images are automatically previewed when printed to
the console, resulting in an interactive editing environment. The latest

for performing common tasks on 'RDF' data, such as reading, writing
and converting between the various serializations of 'RDF' data,
including 'rdfxml', 'turtle', 'nquads', 'ntriples', and 'json-ld';
creating new 'RDF' graphs, and performing graph queries using 'SPARQL'.
This package wraps the low level 'redland' R package which
provides direct bindings to the 'redland' C library.  Additionally,
the package supports the newer and more developer friendly
'JSON-LD' format through the 'jsonld' package. The package

mechanism to manage and query a 'Virtuoso' database using the 'DBI' (Data-Base Interface)

'Virtuoso' is a high-performance ""universal server,"" which can act
as both a relational database, supporting standard Structured Query
Language ('SQL') queries, while also supporting data following the
Resource Description Framework ('RDF') model for Linked Data.
'RDF' data can be queried using 'SPARQL' ('SPARQL' Protocol and 'RDF' Query Language)
queries, a graph-based query that supports semantic reasoning.
This allows users to leverage the performance of local or remote 'Virtuoso' servers using
popular 'R' packages such as 'DBI' and 'dplyr', while also providing a
high-performance solution for working with large 'RDF' 'triplestores' from 'R.'
The package also provides helper routines to install, launch, and manage
a 'Virtuoso' server locally on 'Mac', 'Windows' and 'Linux' platforms using
the standard interactive installers from the 'R' command-line.  By
automatically handling these setup steps, the package can make using 'Virtuoso'
considerably faster and easier for a most users to deploy in a local
environment. Managing the bulk import of triples
from common serializations with a single intuitive command is another key
feature of this package.  Bulk import performance can be tens to
hundreds of times faster than the comparable imports using existing 'R' tools,
including 'rdflib' and 'redland' packages.",MIT + file LICENSE,UTF-8,https://github.com/ropensci/virtuoso,https://ropensci.r-universe.dev,"Carl Boettiger [aut, cre, cph]

MODIStsp,Package,"Find, Download and Process MODIS Land Products Data",2.0.9,"Allows automating the creation of time series of rasters derived
from MODIS satellite land products data. It performs several typical
preprocessing steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojecting and resizing
data acquired on a specified time period. All processing parameters
can be set using a user-friendly GUI. Users can select which layers of
the original MODIS HDF files they want to process, which additional
quality indicators should be extracted from aggregated MODIS quality
assurance layers and, in the case of surface reflectance products,
which spectral indexes should be computed from the original reflectance
bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster
files corresponding to each available acquisition date. Virtual files
allowing access to the entire time series as a single file are also created.
Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved processing options
file is also possible, allowing users to automatically update time series
related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is available.

git2rdata,NA,Store and Retrieve Data.frames in a Git Repository,0.4.0,"The git2rdata package is an R package for writing and reading
dataframes as plain text files.  A metadata file stores important
information.  1) Storing metadata allows to maintain the classes of
variables.  By default, git2rdata optimizes the data for file storage.
The optimization is most effective on data containing factors.  The
optimization makes the data less human readable.  The user can turn
this off when they prefer a human readable format over smaller files.
Details on the implementation are available in vignette(""plain_text"",
package = ""git2rdata"").  2) Storing metadata also allows smaller row
based diffs between two consecutive commits.  This is a useful feature
when storing data as plain text files under version control.  Details
on this part of the implementation are available in
vignette(""version_control"", package = ""git2rdata"").  Although we
envisioned git2rdata with a git workflow in mind, you can use it in
combination with other version control systems like subversion or
mercurial.  3) git2rdata is a useful tool in a reproducible and
traceable workflow.  vignette(""workflow"", package = ""git2rdata"") gives
a toy example.  4) vignette(""efficiency"", package = ""git2rdata"")
provides some insight into the efficiency of file storage, git
repository size and speed for writing and reading.",GPL-3,UTF-8,"https://ropensci.github.io/git2rdata/,

The package was initially developed to calculate the steepness of street segments
but can be used to calculate steepness of any linear feature that can be
represented as LINESTRING geometries in the 'sf' class system.
The package takes two main types of input data for slope calculation: vector geographic
objects representing linear features, and raster geographic objects with elevation values
(which can be downloaded using functionality in the package)
representing a continuous terrain surface.
Where no raster object is provided the package attempts to download elevation
data using the 'ceramic' package.",GPL-3,UTF-8,"https://github.com/ropensci/slopes/,

<doi:10.1242/jeb.114.1.493> modernized the technique for
application in comparative biomechanics. Although our initial motivation
was to provide functions to analyze work loop experiment data, as we
developed the package we incorporated the ability to analyze data from
experiments that are often complementary to work loops. There are currently
three supported experiment types: work loops, simple twitches, and tetanus
trials. Data can be imported directly from .ddf files or via an object
constructor function. Through either method, data can then be cleaned or
transformed via methods typically used in studies of muscle physiology.
Data can then be analyzed to determine the timing and magnitude of force
development and relaxation (for isometric trials) or the magnitude of work,
net power, and instantaneous power among other things (for work loops).
Although we do not provide plotting functions, all resultant objects are
designed to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting or
'tidyverse' functions.

epubr,NA,Read EPUB File Metadata and Text,0.6.3,"Provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. 
The 'epubr' package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files.
E-book metadata and text content are parsed separately and joined together in a tidy, nested tibble data frame.
E-book formatting is not completely standardized across all literature.
It can be challenging to curate parsed e-book content across an arbitrary collection of e-books
perfectly and in completely general form, to yield a singular, consistently formatted output.
Many EPUB files do not even contain all the same pieces of information in their respective metadata.
EPUB file parsing functionality in this package is intended for relatively general application to arbitrary EPUB e-books.
However, poorly formatted e-books or e-books with highly uncommon formatting may not work with this package.
There may even be cases where an EPUB file has DRM or some other property that makes it impossible to read with 'epubr'.
Text is read 'as is' for the most part. The only nominal changes are minor substitutions, for example curly quotes changed to straight quotes.
Substantive changes are expected to be performed subsequently by the user as part of their text analysis.
Additional text cleaning can be performed at the user's discretion, such as with functions from packages like 'tm' or 'qdap'.",MIT + file LICENSE,UTF-8,"https://docs.ropensci.org/epubr/ (website)
